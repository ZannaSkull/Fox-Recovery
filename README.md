# Fox Recovery: Browser Profile Transfer Tool

## Description

`Fox Recovery` is a Python-based utility designed to simplify the process of transferring browser profile data (including logins, cookies, extensions, and settings) from one location to another. This is useful when migrating to a new computer, creating a backup, or moving your profile between different installations of the same browser.

**Important:** This tool copies sensitive data like passwords and cookies. Use it responsibly and only on trusted computers.

## Features

*   **User-friendly GUI:**  Provides a simple graphical interface for selecting source and destination directories.
*   **Automatic Backup:** Creates a timestamped backup of your profile before transferring data to prevent data loss.
*   **Comprehensive Data Transfer:** Copies key files and directories to preserve your logins, cookies, extensions, settings, and browsing sessions.
*   **Logging:** Displays progress messages and any errors in a console log within the GUI.

## Supported Browsers

The script is primarily designed for browsers that store profile data in a similar directory structure. It has been tested with:

*   Mozilla Firefox
*   Waterfox
*   Zen Browser
*   Floorp
*   Midori

## Installation

1.  **Install Python:** Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.  You can download it from [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2.  **Install Tkinter:** Tkinter should come pre-installed with most Python installations. If not, you may need to install it separately using your system's package manager (e.g., `apt-get install python3-tk` on Debian/Ubuntu).
3.  **Download the script:** Save Fox Recovery to a directory of your choice.

## Usage

1.  **Run the script:** Execute the Python script by double-clicking it or running `Fox Recovery.py` from the command line.
2.  **Locate your browser profile directory:**  Follow the instructions within the GUI to find your browser's profile directory.  Common locations are:
    *   **Firefox:** `%APPDATA%\Mozilla\Firefox\Profiles` (You can type this directly into the Explorer address bar)
    *   **Waterfox:** `%APPDATA%\Waterfox\Profiles`
    *   **Zen:** `%APPDATA%\Zen\Profiles`
    *   **Floorp:** `%APPDATA%\Floorp\Profiles`
    *   **Midori:** `%APPDATA%\Midori\Profiles`
3.  **Select source and destination directories:**  Use the "Browse" buttons to select the source profile directory (the profile you want to copy) and the destination directory (where you want to copy it to).
4.  **Start the transfer:** Click the "Start Backup & Transfer" button.
5.  **Monitor the progress:**  Observe the console log for progress messages and any errors.
6.  **Close Browsers:** Ensure all instances of the source and destination browsers are closed before running the script.
7.  **Verify:** After the transfer is complete, open the "destination" browser and verify that your logins, cookies, extensions, and settings have been successfully transferred.

## Important Considerations

*   **Close the browser:** Make sure the browser you are transferring *from* is completely closed before running the script. Otherwise, some files might be in use and cannot be copied correctly. It's generally a good idea to close the browser you are transferring *to* as well, until the transfer is complete.
*   **Profile Compatibility:** Transferring profiles between different browser versions or even different browsers may not always work perfectly. There could be compatibility issues.
*   **Security:** Be cautious when transferring profile data, especially if you are moving it to a computer you don't fully trust. The profile contains sensitive information such as passwords and cookies.
*   **Permissions:** Make sure you have the necessary permissions to read from the source directory and write to the destination directory.
*   **Large Profiles:** If your browser profile is very large, the copying process may take a significant amount of time.

## Troubleshooting

*   **Error: "Source directory does not exist"**: Double-check that you have entered the correct path to the source profile directory.
*   **Error: "Permission denied"**: Ensure you have the necessary permissions to read from the source directory and write to the destination directory.  Try running the script as an administrator.
*   **Transfer seems incomplete**: Make sure the browser you are transferring from is completely closed.  Also, check the console log for any error messages.
*   **Browser doesn't load profile correctly:** Compatibility issues can sometimes occur. Try clearing the browser's cache and restarting it. If issues persist, the profile may not be fully compatible.
